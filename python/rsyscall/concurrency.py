class OneAtATime:
    """Used as part of multiplexing APIs.

    This class is used to control access to the core work loop of
    multiplexing APIs.

    In a multiplexing API, multiple coroutines want to wait for some
    event; one of the waiting coroutines should be selected to perform
    the actual work of polling for the event.

    A multiplexing API will make a OneAtATime, and when each coroutine
    wants to wait for some event, they will enter the needs_run async
    context manager.

    If needs_run yields true, then that coroutine is the first to be
    waiting, and they need to do the actual work.

    If needs_run yields false, then they should just do nothing; this
    is accomlished with an if-condition. The needs-run context manager
    will handle waiting for the working coroutine to complete their
    work.

    This is a terrible API, but it works for now.

    A better API would be a "shared coroutine" which runs whenever any
    other coroutine is waiting on it, and is suspended if no other
    coroutine is waiting on it. A shared coroutine also must not
    require entering a contextmanager to create. We should try to get
    that kind of API merged into trio/asyncio.
